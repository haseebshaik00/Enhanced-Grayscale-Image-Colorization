# Enhanced-Grayscale-Image-Colorization
Improved the efficiency of the model, which converts grayscale images to colored images without human intervention using a unique CNN approach while retaining the image properties and dimensions, through learning rate schedulers, different optimizers, dropouts, and other techniques such as lasso and ridge regression. The aforementioned model can be used by large animation companies in sketching and comic book artists to efficiently color similar panels; it can also be incorporated in medical industries where the majority of machines work on grayscale sensors (ultrasound and MRI scans); and it also provides a preliminary proxy task for data visualization and analysis in data sets collected from sensors.
